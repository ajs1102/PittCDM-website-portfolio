		<h2>PNC Financial Services</h2>
			<p>I worked under Intelligent Automation on the Robotic Process Automation team. 
			I was tasked to create a bot to automate parts of PNC's mortgage setup process with a team of three other interns. 
			By the end of the summer we were able to deliver the product into Quality Assurance.</p>
		<h2>Bentley Systems</h2>
			<p>I created a tool to migrate data for a deprecated service in Microsoft's Azure Table storage to a newer service which used data in CosmoDB.
			I learned how to navigate Microsoft's cloud databases both through the online portal and through C#.</p>
		<h2>University of Pittsburgh</h2>
			<p>I lead a recitation for Introduction to Programming (Java), in which I answer students' questions, and teach labs. 
			I also hold office hours during which students can come in to get one on one help.</p>
